AUC: 1.00 (95% CI: 1.00–1.00)
Sensitivity: 100.0% (95% CI: 83.2%–100.0%)
Specificity: 100.0% (95% CI: 83.2%–100.0%)

DADM-Style Reporting (recommended by expert):
"In this internally validated cohort, participant-level ROI entry and
regression measures showed non-overlapping ranges between MCI and controls,
yielding leakage-safe 10-fold cross-validated discrimination of AUC=1.00
(95% CI 1.00–1.00), with sensitivity of 100.0%
(95% CI 83.2%–100.0%) and specificity of 100.0%
(95% CI 83.2%–100.0%). Given the modest sample size
and clinically well-characterized recruitment, these estimates represent
internal validation and may overestimate real-world performance; external
validation in larger, more heterogeneous cohorts is required."
